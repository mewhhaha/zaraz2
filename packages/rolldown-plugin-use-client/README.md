# @mewhhaha/rolldown-plugin-use-client

Rolldown plugin that lifts inline `"use client"` handlers into standalone client bundles. It emits one client chunk per handler, rewrites the server module to reference the generated file URL, and prunes any imports that are now client-only. Use it when you need to keep server modules lean while still shipping small, on-demand client scripts.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add -D @mewhhaha/rolldown-plugin-use-client rolldown @rolldown/pluginutils typescript
```

The package ships TypeScript sources compiled to ESM. All dependencies listed above are peer dependencies and must exist in the consuming project.

## Quick start

Add the plugin to your `rolldown` config. The default filter covers common JS/TS entrypoints while skipping `node_modules`, so most projects can start with the zero-config setup below.

```ts
// rolldown.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "rolldown";
import useClient from "@mewhhaha/rolldown-plugin-use-client";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    useClient(),
  ],
});
```

### What the transform does

Given a server component that embeds a client handler:

```ts
const LoginForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    "use client";
    event.preventDefault();
    queueMicrotask(() => {
      window.alert("Submitted!");
    });
  };

  return <form on={handleSubmit}>...</form>;
};
```

The plugin will:

1. Hoist the handler into its own module that starts with `"use client";`.
2. Copy any imports and top-level declarations the handler uses into that module.
3. Emit the module as a chunk with `moduleSideEffects === false`.
4. Replace the inline function with `new URL(import.meta.ROLLUP_FILE_URL_<ref>).pathname`, giving you the final asset path at runtime.

You can stash that path, send it down to the client, or map it to a `<script type="module">` tag—whatever your application framework expects.

## Options

```ts
type UseClientPluginOptions = {
  /**
   * Extra @rolldown/pluginutils filter expressions
   * appended to the default include/exclude set.
   */
  filter?: TopLevelFilterExpression | TopLevelFilterExpression[];
};
```

- `filter` &mdash; Additional filter expressions that refine which source files are scanned. The defaults include `**/*.js`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.ts`, and `**/*.tsx`, while excluding anything under `node_modules/`. Supply one or more expressions from `@rolldown/pluginutils` to widen or narrow the search.

## ESLint support

This package also exposes linting helpers under `@mewhhaha/rolldown-plugin-use-client/eslint/use-client`. Register the plugin and select the rules you want:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import useclient from "@mewhhaha/rolldown-plugin-use-client/eslint/use-client";

export default [
  useclient.configs.recommended
];
```

Available rules:

- `no-invalid-inline-client-closure` &mdash; Ensures inline handlers do not capture variables that disappear from the generated client bundle (e.g., component props or local state).
- `require-use-client-directive` &mdash; Requires handlers passed to the `on` JSX attribute to start with a `"use client"` directive so they qualify for extraction.

## Tips and limitations

- Only block-bodied arrow or function expressions with a literal `"use client"` as their first statement qualify for extraction.
- The plugin can follow imports and top-level declarations, but it cannot re-create values from intermediate scopes. Use the ESLint rule (or manually double-check) to avoid capturing component locals.
- The replacement uses `new URL(import.meta.ROLLUP_FILE_URL_ref).pathname`. If you need the full `href` (or another format), wrap the helper yourself—`new URL(import.meta.ROLLUP_FILE_URL_ref, import.meta.url).href` mirrors Rollup's recommended pattern.
- Client modules are stored in an in-memory registry during the build. Restart the build or trigger a fresh incremental run if you edit inline handlers and the output looks stale.
